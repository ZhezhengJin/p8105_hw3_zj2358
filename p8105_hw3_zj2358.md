## Problem 1

``` r
data("instacart")
```

Description of the dataset:

The dataset `instacart` has 1384617 observations and 15 variables.
Variables in the dataset include order_id, product_id,
add_to_cart_order, reordered, user_id, eval_set, order_number,
order_dow, order_hour_of_day, days_since_prior_order, product_name,
aisle_id, department_id, aisle, department. Some key variables include
unique order identifiers (`order_id`, e.g., 13749), the sequence
products are added to the cart (`add_to_cart_order`, e.g., 2 for the
second item), indicators for product reorders (`reordered`, e.g., 0 for
previously ordered), the day an order was placed (`order_dow`, e.g., 2
for Tuesday), and specific product names (`product_name`, e.g., Clean
Linen Candle).

How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
from?

``` r
num_aisles <- n_distinct(instacart$aisle)

top_aisle <- instacart %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(-count) %>%
  slice(1) %>%
  pull(aisle) 
```

There are 134 unique aisles, and the most items are ordered from the
fresh vegetables.

Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
aisle_plot <- instacart %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>%
  summarise(item_count = n()) %>%
  filter(item_count > 10000) %>%
  arrange(-item_count)
ggplot(aisle_plot, aes(x = reorder(aisle, item_count), y = item_count)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(title = "Number of Items Ordered in Each Aisle",
       x = "Aisle",
       y = "Number of Items ordered") +
  theme_minimal()
```

![](p8105_hw3_zj2358_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles
“baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”.
Include the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
popular_items <- instacart %>%
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>%
  summarise(item_count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  arrange(aisle, -item_count) %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>%
  slice_head(n = 3)

knitr::kable(popular_items,caption = "Top 3 Items in Selected Aisles", align = c('l', 'l', 'r'))
```

| aisle                      | product_name                                  | item_count |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-----------:|
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |        499 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |        387 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |        336 |

| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |         26 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          |       9784 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           |       5546 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           |       4966 |

Top 3 Items in Selected Aisles

Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples
and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week.

``` r
product_hour <- instacart %>%
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
  summarise(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") %>%
  spread(key = order_dow, value = mean_hour) %>%
  select(product_name, `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`) 

knitr::kable(product_hour, caption = "Mean Hour of Order by Product and Day of the Week", digits = 2)
```

| product_name     |     0 |     1 |     2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |
|:-----------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77 | 14.32 | 15.38 | 15.32 | 15.22 | 12.26 | 13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |

Mean Hour of Order by Product and Day of the Week

## Problem 2

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010")
```

Data cleaning

``` r
colnames(brfss_smart2010)
```

    ## [23] "GeoLocation"

``` r
brfss_smart2010 <- brfss_smart2010 %>%
  rename(
    location_abbr = Locationabbr,
    location_desc = Locationdesc,
    class_id = ClassId,
    data_source = DataSource,
    topic_id = TopicId,
    location_id = LocationID,
    question_id = QuestionID,
    resp_id = RESPID,
    geo_location = GeoLocation
  ) %>%
    janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(topic == "Overall Health",
         response %in% c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")) %>%
  mutate(response = factor(response, 
                           levels = c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent"),
                           ordered = TRUE))
```

In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What about
in 2010?

``` r
states_with_7_or_more_locations <- brfss_smart2010 %>%
  filter(year %in% c(2002, 2010)) %>%
  group_by(year, location_abbr) %>%
  summarise(num_entries = n_distinct(location_desc)) %>%
  filter(num_entries >= 7)

states_2002 <- states_with_7_or_more_locations %>%
  filter(year == 2002)  %>%
  pull(location_abbr)

states_2010 <- states_with_7_or_more_locations %>%
  filter(year == 2010) %>%
  pull(location_abbr)
```

In 2002, states observed at 7 or more locations were CT, FL, MA, NC, NJ,
PA. In 2010, states observed at 7 or more locations were CA, CO, FL, MA,
MD, NC, NE, NJ, NY, OH, PA, SC, TX, WA.

Construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and
contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data_value
across locations within a state.

``` r
excellent_responses <- brfss_smart2010 %>%
  filter(response == "Excellent") %>%
  group_by(year, location_abbr) %>%
  summarise(avg_data_value = round(mean(data_value, na.rm = TRUE),2))
```

Make a “spaghetti” plot of this average value over time within a state

``` r
ggplot(excellent_responses, aes(x = year, y = avg_data_value, group = location_abbr)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = location_abbr), alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Average value trends for each state",
       y = "Average Data Value") +
  theme_minimal() 
```

![](p8105_hw3_zj2358_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)<!-- -->

Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010,
distribution of data_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among
locations in NY State.

``` r
ny <- brfss_smart2010 %>%
  filter(year %in% c(2006, 2010) & location_abbr == "NY")

ggplot(ny, aes(x = response, y = data_value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~ year, ncol = 2) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Data Value for responses in NY (2006 & 2010)",
       y = "Data Value",
       x = "Response") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Problem 3

Load and clean the datasets

``` r
nhanes_accel <- read_csv("nhanes_accel.csv")  %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
nhanes_covar <- read_csv("nhanes_covar.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
```

Tidy the data

``` r
nhanes_covar <- nhanes_covar[-c(1:4),] 
colnames(nhanes_covar) <- c("seqn", "sex", "age", "bmi", "education")
nhanes_covar$seqn <- as.integer(nhanes_covar$seqn)
nhanes_covar$age <- as.numeric(nhanes_covar$age)
nhanes_covar$bmi <- as.numeric(nhanes_covar$bmi)

nhanes_accel$seqn <- as.integer(nhanes_accel$seqn)
```

Filter the data

``` r
nhanes_covar <- nhanes_covar %>% 
  filter(age >= 21, !is.na(sex), !is.na(age), !is.na(bmi), !is.na(education))
```

Merge

``` r
nhanes <- inner_join(nhanes_covar, nhanes_accel, by = "seqn")
```

Encode data

``` r
nhanes$sex <- factor(nhanes$sex, levels = c("1", "2"), 
                          labels = c("Male", "Female"))

nhanes$education <- factor(nhanes$education, 
                               levels = c("1", "2", "3"), 
                               labels = c("Less than high school", 
                                          "High school equivalent", 
                                          "More than high school"))
```

Produce a Reader-Friendly Table

``` r
education_table <- table(nhanes$sex, nhanes$education)
knitr::kable(education_table, 
             caption = "Number of Men and Women in Each Education Category")
```

|        | Less than high school | High school equivalent | More than high school |
|:-------|----------------------:|-----------------------:|----------------------:|
| Male   |                    27 |                     35 |                    56 |
| Female |                    28 |                     23 |                    59 |

Number of Men and Women in Each Education Category

From the Table:

The dataset contains a fairly balanced distribution of men and women
across different education levels, with no extreme disparities in
numbers. More males (35) have an education equivalent to high school
compared to females (23). In contrast, for education levels beyond high
school, females (59) outnumber males (56).

Visualization of the age distributions

``` r
ggplot(nhanes, aes(x = education, y = age, fill = sex)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Age Distribution by Sex and Education",
       x = "Education Level",
       y = "Age",
       fill = "Sex") +
  theme_minimal()
```

![](p8105_hw3_zj2358_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png)<!-- -->

From the Visualization:

The people from group with a education level more than high school are
the youngest on average, compared to the people from group with a
education level less than high school, who are the oldest on average.
The group with a education level high school equivalent has a wider age
range. The group with the largest gap in age distribution between male
and female is the group with a education level of high school
equivalent.

Create a total activity variable for each participant & Plotting

``` r
nhanes$total_activity <- rowSums(nhanes[, grep("^min", names(nhanes))])
ggplot(nhanes, aes(x = age, y = total_activity, color = sex)) +
  geom_point(aes(shape = sex), alpha = 0.5) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) + 
  facet_wrap(~ education) + 
  labs(title = "Total Activity with Age by Sex and Education Level",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Total Activity",
       color = "Sex",
       shape = "Sex") +
  theme_minimal()
```

![](p8105_hw3_zj2358_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png)<!-- -->

From the Visualization:

The trend consistent across education levels. For all education levels,
there is a negative correlation between the total activity and age,
which means the total activity decrease with age, and the trend is the
same for men and women. The group with the education level less than
high school shows more total activity than the other two groups for both
male and female. For groups of high school equivalent and more than high
school, women always have more total activity than men at the same age.

Make a three-panel plot

``` r
nhanes_new <-nhanes %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("min"), 
               names_to = "minute", 
               values_to = "activity") %>%
  mutate(minute = as.integer(gsub("min", "", minute)))

ggplot(nhanes_new, aes(x = minute, y = activity, color = sex)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ education, scales = "free_y", ncol = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Hour", breaks = seq(0, 1440, 60), labels = 0:24) +
  labs(title = "24-hour Activity Time Courses by Education Level",
       y = "Activity",
       color = "Sex") +
  theme_minimal()
```

![](p8105_hw3_zj2358_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png)<!-- -->

From the Visualization, we can conclude that:

1.  There’s nearly no gender difference in activity patterns across
    three education groups from the smooth trends.

2.  For all three groups, they are more active from about 9 am to 8 pm.

3.  The average daily activity time of the three groups is ranked as:
    less than high school \> high school equivalent \> more than high
    school.

4.  The group with more than high school education shows more consistent
    activity with less peaks and troughs.
